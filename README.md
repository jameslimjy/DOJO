DOJO is a dapp that facilitates student-teacher interactions using DOJO (an ERC20 token).

There are 3 entities involved: Student, Teacher & Treasury.

There are 3 types of activities in this dapp: Classes, Consults & Assignments.

## Quick start:

Terminal 1 - Start Local Hardhat Network

```
npx hardhat node
```

Terminal 2 - Deploy SC

```
npx hardhat run deployments/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Terminal 3 - Start React Frontend

```
npm start
```

If you encounter this error `received invalid block tag` in the local hardhat network terminal, change to a different network in MetaMask and change back to Hardhat Network, this will reset the cache in MetaMask. Read more [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/109625/received-invalid-block-tag-87-latest-block-number-is-0). Or, if that doesn't work, then reset your activity tab in MetaMask.

## Tokenomics

- Students' POV
  - given 5 DOJO when enrolling for the first time
  - use DOJO to pay for classes
  - stake DOJO when signing up for consults
  - earn DOJO by participating in assignments
- Teacher's POV
  - start with 0 DOJO
  - DOJO is used to determine how much work a teacher as done, i.e. accumulate more tokens = have done more work
  - DOJO can be traded in to the treasury in exchange for fiat (teachers' salary)
- Treasury's POV
  - used to track how much work each teacher has been doing

## Activities

- Classes
  - teachers create classes
  - students pay DOJO to attend the classes
- Consults
  - teachers create consult sessions
  - students stake DOJO to indicate their interest in attending (staked DOJO is locked up in treasury)
  - when the consult is over, the teacher will confirm the students' attendance and the staked DOJO will be returned
- Assignments
  - teachers can submit assignments to the treasury
  - after the treasury verifies it, students can apply to join
  - when the teacher verifies that the assignment has been completed by the student, the teacher can issue the assignment's bounty to the student (paid out from the treasury)
